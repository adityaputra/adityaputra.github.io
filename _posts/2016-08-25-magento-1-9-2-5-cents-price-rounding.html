  content: Thank you! This was exactly what I had to do for a Swiss online shop that
    I'm developing for in my job. The client will be happy that you saved me so much
    time - because he pays per hour. You saved me so many headaches because I'm not
    yet a Magento expert.

    Hi, thanks for coming in!

    In my case, it was working well both for simple and configurable products. Do you have the product URL?

<p>Today I am working on a Magento site for a Switzerland client which&nbsp;requires the implementation of Rappen Rounding, a 5-cents rounding for&nbsp;the total price for every transaction.</p>
<p>I actually found an extension on <a href="https://github.com/openstream/Magento5CentRounding" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for that, but it was not compatible with my Magento install. I am&nbsp;not sure if it is&nbsp;not compatible with Magento 1.9.2 or conflicting with&nbsp;any other extensions, it just didn't work.</p>
<p>After digging into Magento core codes, I found that&nbsp;there is a simple workaround for this functionality, though we have to override Magento's&nbsp;core.<!--more--> Please be advised that&nbsp;this is not the best practice, it is just a simple workaround. If you want a better functionality and compatibility with&nbsp;future Magento updates, you'd better build a custom module / extension for that.</p>
<p>Here's what I did&nbsp;as a workaround:</p>
<ol>
<li>Override Magento's core by copying<br />
<code>app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/store.php</code><br />
to<br />
<code><code>app/code/local/Mage/Core/Model/store.php</code></code>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Edit the new copied file on the<br />
<code><code>function&nbsp;roundPrice($price){}</code></code>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Replace the line<br />
<code>return round ($ price, 2);</code><br />
with<br />
<code><code>return round($price * 2, 1)/2;</code></code>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Save</li>
<li>Flush Magento Cache, and&nbsp;it's done!</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me know if it helps!</p>
