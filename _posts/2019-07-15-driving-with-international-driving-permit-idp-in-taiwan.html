<p>Hope that this info is still valid since it's been more than one year since I&nbsp;did the whole processes. In short, I bought my first car in Taiwan last year (without having a valid local nor international license). I am not sure if it was legal, but the previous car owner took care of everything. I only needed to provide ARC and a secondary ID card to have the car transferred under my name.</p>
<p>After I got my car, I returned back to my home country Indonesia for vacation while also getting my international driving permit. The process was very simple and easy. Once I&nbsp;got back to Taiwan, I immediately registered my license with the local DMV office. There, they gave me a piece a paper stapled on my IDP (some people refer it as a IDP visa) as a proof that my IDP can be used after 30 days of my stay in Taiwan. Note that if you don't have your IDP registered, you can only&nbsp;drive with IDP for 30 days upon your arrival in Taiwan.</p>
<p>In order to get the IDP visa, you only need to bring your ARC and/or passport (better to take both of them) and some photographs. Bring it to the counter and they will know what to do. The whole process was very quick, like 10-15 mins include waiting time. I didn't need to pay anything for that but yesterday I read somewhere that starting from April 2019 the government needs the applicant to pay 150 TWD (correct me if I am wrong) for the application fee.</p>
<p>Using that paper, you will be able to drive until your ARC / Visa date of expiry up to maximum one year. In my case I was only got few months&nbsp;to match my ARC expiration date. However, after I got my new ARC, I can re-apply for IDP registration and got one year extension.</p>
<p>Give it a try and let me know what you think.</p>
